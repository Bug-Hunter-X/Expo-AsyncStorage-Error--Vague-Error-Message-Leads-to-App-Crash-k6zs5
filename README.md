# Expo AsyncStorage Error: Vague Error Message Leads to App Crash

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in an Expo managed workflow application when using AsyncStorage. The application crashes unexpectedly, providing a vague error message that makes debugging challenging.

The `bug.js` file contains the code exhibiting the problematic behavior. The `bugSolution.js` provides a potential solution and demonstrates how to effectively handle potential errors when working with AsyncStorage in an Expo environment.

## Reproducing the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run `expo start` to start the Expo development server.
4. Observe the application behavior and the error message in the Expo development client or console.

## Solution

The provided solution in `bugSolution.js` addresses the issue by implementing robust error handling during AsyncStorage operations.  It demonstrates how to catch and handle specific errors, providing more informative feedback for debugging and improving the overall application stability.
